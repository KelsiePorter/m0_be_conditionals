# Self Evaluation

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the comparison operators?

    I am feeling fairly comfortable however, I did catch myself referencing my notes on the conditional statements a lot.
1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the logical operators?

    The logical operators were easier for me to understand and memorize right away.
1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the if statements?

    I am feeling fairly confident. I understand the process and how to use comparison operators and logical operators in an if statement. However, if I start working too fast or get slightly distracted, I tend to make tiny errors. For example, in my code challenge video, I was trying to focus on articulating what I was doing and messed up my conditional statement which I did not catch until I tried to run my code in the terminal. I need to slow down and pay close attention to detail.
1. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate?

    I spent about 3 hours to do this lesson and all three code challenges. I definitely underestimated how much time it would take when I was calendaring. I am learning that I need to allot for time to research in addition to the lesson itself.
1. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?

    I think comparison operators would be a great thing to make flashcards for. I have scheduled time on my calendar to take a few minutes to create some flashcards. I can test myself when I have a few minutes of free time.
1. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?

    - How do you integrate prompts for the user into an if statement? For example, in the spicy challenge. How would you ask the user questions and have that answer determine the next if statement?
    - For this question, I would start by just googling 'ruby terminal user input in an if statement' and see if there is an example on stack overflow or if I can find a ruby lesson on the topic. I can then test it for myself in atom and my terminal.
